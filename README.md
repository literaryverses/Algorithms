# Algorithms
A collection of personal projects to explore some algorithms in python. Within each folder is a topic which contains the code and a textfile for references.

## Sorting <a name="sorting"></a>
Sorting is an operation that puts elements of an array into an order, most frequently numerical or lexicographical. Here, I explore different types of sorting algorithms and their methods.

### bubblesort.py
Bubble sort is simplest and most impractical sorting algorithm that swaps out adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order, with a runtime of O(n<sup>2</sup>). Variants of bubble sorting is explored, such as modified bubble sort (which quits when no swaps are made) and cocktail shaker sort (bidirectional bubble sort).

### insertsort.py
Insertion sort partitions an array and then inserts elements from the unsorted section to the sorted one. Variants of this algorithm uses bidirectional insertion or binary search insertion.


## Maze Generation <a name="maze_generation"></a>
Maze generation algorithms use automated methods to create mazes.

### objects.py
Creating data structures via cell and grid classes to serve as the foundation of the maze.

### binaryTrees.py
For each cell in the grid, the binary tree's algorithm destroys either a longitudinal or latitudinal wall, using an equiprobable random selection.

### sidewinder.py
The sidewinder algorithm processes each cell by determining if its eastern walls is at the border, then either destroying the right wall if not using an equiprobable random choice. If the wall is not destroyed, then any cell preceding the current one within that row will destroy its northern wall.

### aldous_broder.py
A random-walk based algorithm that breaks down walls between unvisited cells until all the cells in the grid are visited.

### wilsons.py
A random-walk based algorithm that draws multiple paths from unvisited cells to a visited one until there are no more unvisited cells.


## Floorplans <a name="floorplans"></a>
In electronic design automation, a floorplan of an integrated circuit is a schematics representation of tentative placement of its major functional blocks. Here, I look into mathematical models to generate the optimal floorplan.

### internalAR.py
Returns iterations of a binary tree based on *n* internal nodes via recursion. The iterations are provided as array representation: the top row represents the left subtrees, the bottom row represents the right subtrees, and each column represents an internal node in order of preorder traversal.

### skarbek.py
Performs the same operation as internalAR.py, but uses Skarbek's Algorithm instead. The algorithm is nonrecursive and its runtime per tree is O(1). References are provided in floorplans/resources.txt

### createsFP.py
Generates the dimensions of a slicing floorplan along with its corresponding normalized Polish Expression based on the number of slices performed on the floorplan.

### expConvert.py
Translates expressions between postfix notation and infix notation using stacks and queues. Three algorithms are implemented for translating infix notation to postfix notation, among them Dijkstra's Shunting-Yard algorithm.

### expandFP.py
Slicing floorplans can be represented by Polish Expressions (postfix notation). Given a set of dimensions and a Polish Expression, this program caculates the overall height and width of the floorplan.

### orientsFP.py
Implements Stockmeyer's polynomial-time algorithm for finding optimal orientations for slicing floorplans.  Needs three inputs: a normalized Polish Expression representing the floorplan, a string of dimensions represented as '(height, width)...' and non-decreasing cost function Ïˆ that uses h and w (representing height and width respectively) as parameters.
