# Algorithms
A collection of personal projects to explore some algorithms in python. Within each folder is a topic which contains the code and a textfile for references.

## Floorplans <a name="floorplans"></a>
In electronic design automation, a floorplan of an integrated circuit is a schematics representation of tentative placement of its major functional blocks. Here, I look into mathematical models to generate the optimal floorplan.

### Skarbek.py
Using Skarbek's algorithm to create permutations of array representations of binary trees based on a given number of internal nodes. An array representation is given a top row representing the left subtrees and a bottom row representing the right subtrees, and each column represents an internal node in order of preorder traversal.
